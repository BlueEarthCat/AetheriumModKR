## What is Aetherium?
Aetherium is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adds in a few items of varying tiers.
Most of the item ideas listed were sourced from the ideas channel on the official discord,
and as such the ones that were I will list the person that came up with the idea next to them.

## The mod so far has the following items implemented:
----
- **Feathered Plume** (Original idea by Ajarl, altered a tiny bit)
	- **White Rarity** - Gain a temporary 7% speed boost upon taking damage that stacks 3 times for 5 seconds. (+3 stacks and +0.5 second duration per additional Feathered Plume.)
----
 - **Shielding Core** (Original idea by NepNep)
	- **Green Rarity** - You gain 10  (+5 per stack) armor while BLUE shields are active.
----
- **Shark Teeth** (Original idea by FancyFrenc)
	- **Green Rarity** - 25% of damage taken (+25% per stack, hyperbolically) is distributed to you over 5 seconds as bleed damage.
----
- **Blood Soaked Shield** (Original Idea by Kaboose, altered quite a fair bit)
	- **Green Rarity** - Killing an enemy restores 10% max shield (+10% per stack hyperbolically.)
	- **Upcoming** - The first of the stack of this item will grant a small portion of shield on pickup.
----
- **Alien Magnet** (Original Idea, if you call a vacuum original)
	- **Lunar Rarity** - Enemies hit by your attacks will be pulled towards you, starting at 6x force (+1 force multiplier, up to 10x total force. The effect is more noticeable on higher health enemies.)
----
- **Weighted Anklet** (Original Idea)
	- **Lunar Rarity** - Gain a 25% reduction to knockback from attacks (+25% per stack (up to 100%) linearly). Lose 10% move speed (+10% per stack (up to 40%) linearly).
	- **Upcoming** - I may up the cap for the movement speed loss to allow a bigger downside when using randomizers or challenges.
